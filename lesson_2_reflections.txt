What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we innitialize a repo we convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
In the staging area files are changed but not commited yet, it is an stage before the commit.
The working directory is a directory of hierarchical file system.
The repository stores files as they change (commit objects & set of references to commit objects or HEADS)

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area is useful because it serves as a good testing place for things you are serious about committing. You can compare the contents of the staging area to that of the working directory and the most recent commit. This allows you to make sure you commits are logically separate because you can compare files before you make commits.
